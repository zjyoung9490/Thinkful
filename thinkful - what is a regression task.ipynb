You want to measure the factors that affect the level of development in these countries. To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population.

    "So to form this as a regression problem, we would have our continuous outcome which is the amount paid for services. As a customer utilizes more free services, we would expect the customers to buy more paid services. Since I work in the electrical industry I'll formulate the task through that industry. Some of the free services we offer would be examining small electrical issues within a residence, for example if a breaker has been tripped or why a switch isn't working. As the number of these free services goes up for a customer, we would expect that there are more problems with that residence and as a result fixing those problems will be more costly and result in more paid services. Upon our analysis we may find that some of the free inspections actually lead to more profitable repairs and this could be beneficial for the company. "
